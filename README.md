This quick and easy game was made by following Kenny Yip Coding's YouTube tutorial. It was a great adventure, and I felt really close to home by doing this, as I am a Game Development graduate(2017). 
Since then, I have been focusing on Data Science, so this was a fresh and welcome break. 
Notice, however, that I had to change a line or two when it comes to comparing the original tutorial, because my program required so. But essentially, it is the same. 
I plan to upgrade it in the future with more features and details, perhaps. For now, that's it!
Just download the code and let it roll on your own IDE(I used PyCharm) so you could have some fun - millennial and X gen style. 
Who knows what I will replicate next? Tetris, who knows?
Have a great day, and great fun!
